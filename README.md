## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid areas
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass
- BEM

### What I learned

I only ran into one issue in this challenge. Nesting pseudo-classes :hover and :focus didn't work. I coded it as I would have in css without Sass.

### Continued development

I need to find out what went on and if and how I can nest pseudo-classes in Sass.

### Useful resources
